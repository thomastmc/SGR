# Simple Geometry of Reality (SGR)

**A Geometric Unification Framework for Time, Mass, and Dark Energy.**

> This repository contains the foundational manuscripts and derived applications of the SGR framework, which posits a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold ($M$) with a kinematic foliation as the origin of physical observables.
