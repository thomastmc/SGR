# Simple Geometry of Reality (SGR)

​A Geometric Unification Framework for Time, Mass, and Dark Energy.

​This repository contains the foundational manuscripts and derived applications of the SGR framework, which posits a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M) with a kinematic foliation as the origin of physical observables.

​## Repository Structure

### ​/physics

​Contains: The core theoretical manuscripts (Papers I & II).
​Content: Rigorous mathematical derivations of the Twist Invariant \omega(t), the Wick Rotation mechanism, and the Soliton solutions for fermion identity.
​Status: Pure Theory (Independent Derivation).

​### /corollary

​Contains: Applications, structural instantiations, and datasets.
​Content: Analysis of the "Geometric Engine" and correlations with external datasets (including the 2025 Giza SAR tomography).
​Status: Applied Physics & Structural Analysis.
